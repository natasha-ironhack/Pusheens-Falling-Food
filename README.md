Pusheen's Falling Food

Description:
"Pusheen Loves Food" is a game where the player has to move Pusheen
the cat, left and right, with arrow keyboards, and catch the falling food objects that appear from the top of the screen. The game ends when Pusheen catches low-fat cat food.

MVP (DOM - CANVAS):
-game has one cat that moves horizontally
-food drops randomly from the top of the screen
-cat catches the falling food objects, which all have different scores
-catching low-fat cat food objects will end the game

Backlog:
-add scoreboard
