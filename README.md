# Pusheens-Falling-Food

The objective of the game is to catch as much of the falling food items as
you can. Beware of the low-fat cat food though--Pusheen the cat hates healthy food, so you will lose health points if you catch that item.

Use the arrow keys to move Pusheen left and right.

Press 'n' for a booster.

LAYOUT:
How do these falling food elements interact with the score and health board?
Do each element behave differently?
If so, put them in separate classes (all food in one class, low fat in another class)
